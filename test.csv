"AWS Glue Studio, AWS Glue Crawlers, AWS Glue Data Catalog, AWS Glue Schema Registry, and AWS Glue ETL (""Glue ETL Services"")"
"AWS Glue DataBrew (“Glue DataBrew”)"
"AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts to make each Included Service available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage for each AWS region, during any monthly billing cycle, of at least 99.9% (the “Service Commitment”)."
"In the event an Included Servic e does not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below."
"Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the charges paid by you for **the applicable Included Service in the affected AWS region for the monthly billing cycle in which the Monthly Uptime Percentage for a given AWS region fell within the ranges set forth in the table below:"
"Less than 99.9% but equal to or greater than 99.0% 10%"
"Less than 99.0% but equal to or greater than 95.0%	25%"
"Less than 95.0% 100%"
"We will apply any Service Credits only against future payments otherwise due from you**for the Included Service."
"At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credits to the credit card you used to pay for the billing cycle in which the Included Service did not meet the Service Commitment."
"Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability or non-performance or other failure by us to provide the Included Services  is the receipt of Service Credits (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA."
"To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle after which the incident occurred and must include: (i) the words “SLA Credit Request” in the subject line; (ii) the billing cycle and AWS regions with respect to which you are claiming Service Credits, together with the Monthly Uptime Percentage for that AWS region for the billing cycle and the specific dates, times, and a vailabilities for each 5-minute interval with less than 100% a vailability in that AWS region throughout the billing cycle; (iii) your Request or Job Run logs that document the errors for your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks)."
"If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such credit request is confirmed by us and is less than the **applicable Service Commitment, then we will issue the Service Credits to you within one billing cycle following the month in which the credit request occurred."
"The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension, or termination of **an Included Service, or any other Included Service performance issues: (i) caused by factors outside of our reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of the Included Service; (ii) that result from any voluntary actions or inactions from you; (iii) that result from you not following the recommendations described in the AWS"
"Glue Documentation  on the AWS Site; (iv) that result from your equipment, software or other technology; or (v) arising from our suspension or termination of your right to use the Included Service in accordance with the Agreement (collectively, the “AWS Glue SLA Exclusions”)."
"“API Availability” is calculated for each 5-minute interval as the percentage of Requests processed by the Included Service that do not fail with Errors."
"For Glue ETL Services, is calculated for each 5-minute interval as the percentage of Glue ETL Services Job Runs scheduled or run on-demand by invoking StartJobRun or StartTrigger API that do not result in a Failure. If you did not have any Glue ETL Services Job Runs scheduled or triggered in a given 5-minute interval, that interval is assumed to be 100% available."
"For Glue DataBrew, is calculated for each 5-minute interval as the percentage of Glue DataBrew Job Runs scheduled or run on-demand that do not result in a Failure."
"If you did not have any Glue DataBrew Job Runs scheduled or start ed in a given 5-minute interval, that interval is assumed to be 100% available."
"A “Failure” is any Glue ETL Services Job Run or Glue DataBrew Job Run, as applicable, that returns an error with the text ‘Resource Unavailable."
"A “Glue DataBrew Job Run” is the execution of a job, which is the business logic required to perform recipe or profiling work on a dataset."
"Glue DataBrew Job Run is are initiated by schedules."
"A “Glue ETL Services Job Run” is the execution of a job, which is the business logic required to perform extract, transform, and load (ETL) work and which is composed of a transformation script, data sources, and data targets. Glue ETL Services Job Runs are initiated by triggers that can be scheduled or triggered by events."
"“Monthly Uptime Percentage” for a given AWS region is calculated for a monthly billing cycle as the lower of (a) the average of the API Availability for the Included Service for all 5-minute intervals in the monthly billing cycle, or (b) the average of the Job Run Availability for the Included Service for all 5-minute intervals in the monthly billing cycle. Monthly Uptime Percentage measurements exclude downtime resulting directly or indirectly from any AWS Glue SLA Exclusions"
"For Glue ETL Services, an invocation of any Glue ETL Services API."
"For Glue DataBrew, an invocation of any Glue DataBrew  API."
