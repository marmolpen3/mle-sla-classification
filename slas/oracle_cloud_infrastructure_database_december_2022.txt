Availability Service Level Agreement
With respect to a Cloud Service listed above for which the Availability Service Level Agreement under
this subsection applies, Oracle will use commercially reasonable efforts to have each such Service
available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (as defined below) of at least 99.9% during any calendar
month (the “Service Commitment”). In the event an applicable Cloud Service listed above does not meet
its Service Commitment for the Availability Service Level Agreement under this subsection, You will be
eligible to receive Service Credits for such Non-Compliant Service, with the Service Credit Percentage
determined as follows:
Monthly Uptime Percentage Service Credit Percentage
Less than 99.9% but equal to or greater than 99.0% 10%
Less than 99.0% but equal to or greater than 95.0% 25%
Less than 95.0% 100%
Oracle PaaS and IaaS Public Cloud Services Pillar Document | December 2022 Page 36 of 108
The following terms apply to the Availability Service Level Agreement for the applicable Cloud Services
listed above:
 “Monthly Uptime Percentage” is calculated by subtracting from 100%, the percentage of
minutes during the calendar month in which the applicable Cloud Service was Unavailable (as
defined below).
 “Unavailable” means, on a per-Availability Domain basis, any time when: (i) no virtual machine
(or, where applicable, none of the virtual machines in a Real Application Cluster (RAC)
configuration) of the applicable Cloud Service is able to receive a network connection from an
application or a user, and (ii) no I/O operation can be issued to the block storage of such Cloud
Service. This excludes circumstances resulting directly or indirectly from any Common
Exclusion.
Manageability Service Level Agreement
With respect to a Cloud Service listed above for which the Manageability Service Level Agreement under
this subsection applies, Oracle will use commercially reasonable efforts to have each such Service
available with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (as defined below) of at least 99.9% during any calendar
month (the “Service Commitment”). In the event an applicable Cloud Service listed above does not meet
its Service Commitment for the Manageability Service Level Agreement under this subsection, You will
be eligible to receive Service Credits for such Non-Compliant Service, with the Service Credit Percentage
determined as follows:
Monthly Uptime Percentage Service Credit Percentage
Less than 99.9% but equal to or greater than 99.0% 10%
Less than 99.0% but equal to or greater than 95.0% 25%
Less than 95.0% 100%
The following terms apply to the Manageability Service Level Agreement for the applicable Cloud
Services listed above:
 “Control Plane API Error Rate” means, on a per Availability Domain basis, the percentage value
corresponding to: (i) the total number of internal server errors returned by the applicable Cloud
Service with an error status of “Internal Service Error” or “Service Unavailable” in a five-minute
period during a calendar month divided by, (ii) the total number of Control Plane API requests
made to such Cloud Service in such five-minute period. This excludes circumstances resulting
directly or indirectly from any Common Exclusion.
 “Monthly Uptime Percentage” is calculated by subtracting from 100%, the average of the Control
Plane API Error Rate for each five-minute period during the applicable calendar month.
